Sleeker, faster, and more efficient, Hye Ararat Yergu is a breakthrough in infrastructure management.

# Radically New Architecture
Hye Ararat Yergu brings a brand new architectual system to the table. Ararat is built on the incredible LXD platform, but in previous versions (in order for proper authentication), we had to re-make every LXD endpoint and add our own checks on each endpoint, leading to unexpected bugs and slowdowns. Now, no longer. Hye Ararat Yergu ships with OIDC authentication, and communicates directly with LXD. This means that Hye Ararat Yergu ships with the stability of LXD, and much better performance as it no longer needs to jump through hoops to get things done, making Yergu the most performant Hye Ararat yet.

# Completely New Design
Hye Ararat Yergu ships with a completely new design language. Optimized for greater flexibility device sizes, Yergu lets you work whether you are on the go, or on the big screen. Hye Ararat Yergu also fits complex information into compact spaces while mainting visual comfort and flexibility, leaving the days of constantly switching between pages behind.

# Reverse Proxy Support
Reverse proxies are a huge part of everyday infrastructure, and using a third-party tool to manage them just doesn't cut it. Hye Ararat Yergu allows you to manage your reverse proxies directly from the platform, giving you a unified space to manage **all** of your cloud infrastructure.
